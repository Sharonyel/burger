# Eat Da Burger

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. This app is created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Node and MySQL are used to query and route data, and Handlebars to generate HTML.

How to use:

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the burger will display in the burgers to eat area -- waiting to be eaten.
Click the burger to eat it and the burger will move to the burgers that have been eaten area.
